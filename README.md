# Airline-Delays-and-Cancellations
## Project Overview
This project analyzes airline flight delays and cancellations to uncover patterns and insights that can help airlines, airports, and passengers better understand the factors influencing flight punctuality. Using data from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the analysis explores correlations between weather, airline operations, airport congestion, and delays.

## The project includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Correlation analysis of features with delays.
- Visualization of patterns and trends.
- Insights and recommendations.
